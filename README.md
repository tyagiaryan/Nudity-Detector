# Nudity-Detector
This project implements a nudity detection system using deep learning techniques. The model is trained using the VGG19 architecture and achieves high accuracy in identifying and classifying images as "Nude" or "NonNude". It can be used as a content filtering tool to prevent the distribution or display of explicit or adult content.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training the nudity detection model should consist of two classes: "Nude" and "NonNude". It should be organized into separate folders for training, testing, and validation. Make sure to have a diverse and representative dataset for accurate results.

## Model Architecture
The nudity detection model is based on the VGG19 architecture, a popular convolutional neural network (CNN) model that has been pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. The pre-trained weights of the VGG19 model are used as initial weights, and the top layers are modified for nudity classification.

The model consists of several convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers. The final layer uses the softmax activation function to classify the input image as "Nude" or "NonNude".

## Training
The model is trained using the fit() function provided by the Keras library. It uses the ImageDataGenerator class for data augmentation and normalization. The training process includes several epochs, and early stopping is employed to prevent overfitting.

## Evaluation
After training, the model's performance is evaluated using the test set. Accuracy, loss, and other relevant metrics are calculated to assess the model's effectiveness in detecting nudity.

## Prediction
To make predictions on new images, you can use the saved model. Provide the path to the image file in the code and run the script. The model will load the image, preprocess it, and predict whether it contains nudity or not.
